# ansible-role-skeleton

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systemli/ansible-role-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/systemli/ansible-role-skeleton) [![Ansible Galaxy](http://img.shields.io/badge/ansible--galaxy-skeleton-blue.svg)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/systemli/skeleton/)

This role contains all basic information we use to develop and test Ansible roles. You can easily use this skeleton to start developing new roles.

## Why

We try to open source as much as possible how we build our infrastructure and deploy services. To maintain a bunch of roles we decided to reuse the testing and development process. For this case we store this information in this skeleton and update our roles when we update the skeleton.

## Usage

    # init a new role
    ./init-role.sh /path/to/new-role

    # update an existing role
    ./update-role.sh /path/to/role
